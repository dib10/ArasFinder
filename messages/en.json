    "q1": "Is Aras Finder free?",
    "a1": "Yes, the tool is 100% free. The project is maintained through community support. If you find the tool useful, you can consider making a donation through the \"Buy me a coffee\" link in the footer.",
    "q2": "Why should I use Aras Finder instead of searching directly on LinkedIn/Indeed?",
    "a2": "Aras Finder builds much more precise search URLs than you can create manually. It uses boolean operators (like NOT and \"-\") to exclude unwanted terms, something the standard platform interfaces don't offer easily. This results in less \"noise\" and more relevant job postings.",
    "q3": "Is my search data saved?",
    "a3": "No. Aras Finder does not store any information about your searches. All the URL-building logic happens in your browser. Your privacy is fully respected.",
    "q4": "What does \"Powerful Mode (Experimental)\" mean?",
    "a4": "Powerful Mode adds automatic exclusions to your search (e.g., if you search for \"Mid-level\", it excludes \"Junior\" and \"Internship\"). It is \"experimental\" because, although very effective, LinkedIn's algorithm can sometimes interpret these complex searches in unexpected ways. We recommend Precise Mode for most cases.",
    "q5": "Why am I seeing ads on the site?",
    "a5": "Aras Finder displays ads to help cover the maintenance and hosting costs of the tool, keeping it free for all users. The ads are provided by an external advertising network and are not authored by or the responsibility of us. We have no control over the specific content of the ads displayed, nor are we responsible for the advertised sites or products. We always recommend caution when clicking on any online ad."
