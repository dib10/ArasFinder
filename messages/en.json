    "q1": "Is Aras Finder free?",
    "a1": "Yes, the tool is 100% free. The project is maintained through community support. If you find the tool useful, you can consider making a donation through the \"Buy me a coffee\" link in the footer.",
    "q2": "Why should I use Aras Finder instead of searching directly on LinkedIn/Indeed?",
    "a2": "Aras Finder builds much more precise search URLs than you can create manually. It uses boolean operators (like NOT and \"-\") to exclude unwanted terms, something the standard platform interfaces don't offer easily. This results in less \"noise\" and more relevant job postings.",
    "q3": "Is my search data saved?",
    "a3": "No. Aras Finder does not store any information about your searches. All the URL-building logic happens in your browser. Your privacy is fully respected.",
    "q4": "What does \"Powerful Mode (Experimental)\" mean?",
    "a4": "Powerful Mode adds automatic exclusions to your search (e.g., if you search for \"Mid-level\", it excludes \"Junior\" and \"Internship\"). It is \"experimental\" because, although very effective, LinkedIn's algorithm can sometimes interpret these complex searches in unexpected ways. We recommend Precise Mode for most cases."
